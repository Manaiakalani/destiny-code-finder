## Updating the Catalogue

Code Vault ships a reviewed catalogue rather than scraping community sites in the browser.

1. Confirm a code and reward against Bungie plus at least one independent public reference.
2. Update `src/services/codeCatalogService.ts`.
3. Update reward metadata in `public/data/emblems.json`, then run `npm run sync:emblems`.
4. Update the catalogue review date only after the full list has been checked.
5. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for any questions or reach out on:
